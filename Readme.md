# AR/VR Challenge Token Smart Contract

## Project Title
AR/VR Challenge Token (ARVR)

## Project Description
The AR/VR Challenge Token smart contract incentivizes developers by rewarding them with tokens upon completing AR/VR development challenges. It provides a transparent and automated way for challenge creators (owners) to manage and distribute rewards for successful project completions.

## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to encourage innovation in AR/VR development by gamifying the process through blockchain technology. Developers are rewarded with tokens for their efforts, fostering growth and collaboration in the AR/VR ecosystem.

## Key Features
1. **Token System**:
   - Implements a basic fungible token with a fixed total supply.
   - Compatible with standard Ethereum wallets.

2. **Challenge Management**:
   - Owners can create challenges with specific rewards and mark them as active or inactive.
   - Developers are rewarded upon successful completion of challenges.

3. **Transparent Rewards**:
   - Token transfers are publicly recorded on the blockchain.
   - Developers can track their earned tokens.

4. **Security**:
   - Only the contract owner can create, manage, or approve challenge completions.
   - Prevents duplicate reward claims for the same challenge.

5. **Interoperability**:
   - The token adheres to standard ERC20 functionality, enabling integration with other blockchain platforms.

## Future Enhancements
- **Multi-Owner Support**: Allow multiple administrators to create and manage challenges.
- **Time-Limited Challenges**: Add expiration dates for challenges.
- **Leaderboard System**: Track top developers based on tokens earned.
- **Token Staking**: Implement a staking mechanism for developers to earn additional rewards.
